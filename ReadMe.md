# This is project one of Data Structures and Algorimths of Udacity

## Purpose
    The purpose of this project is to teach the individual how to solve problems in a multi-step manor while analyzing the bigO runtime of the project. 

### Runtime Analysis
    Task0: O(5)
    Task1: O(n) - regular loops
    Task2: O(n2) - nested loop
    Task3: O(n) - regular loops
    Task4: O(n) - regular loops
